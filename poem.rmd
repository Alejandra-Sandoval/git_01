We wear the mask that grins and lies,  
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,â€”  
This debt we pay to human guile;  
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,  
And mouth with myriad subtleties.  
  
Why should the world be over-wise,  
In counting all our tears and sighs?  
Nay, let them only see us, while  
       We wear the mask.  
  
We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries  
To thee from tortured souls arise.  
We sing, but oh the clay is vile  
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;  
But let the world dream otherwise,  
       We wear the mask!
